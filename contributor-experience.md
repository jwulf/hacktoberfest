# Creating an Extraordinary Contributor Experience

This document is for open source project maintainers who want to increase community contributions to their project. 

We'll look at the Contributor Experience and how you can create an Extraordinary Contributor Experience.

## So You're a Maintainer

You're an open source project maintainer. 

You're probably also a contributor to the project - maybe the only one. 

Wouldn't it be great to have other people making contributions to the codebase?

Or maybe you're part of a team that works professionally on a code base. Maybe you have users asking for features and bug fixes. Wouldn't it be great if the contributions grew at the same rate as the requests?

Contributors not only provide value to the project by testing, opening issues, and contributing code, they also become advocates for the project in the wider community. And why not? It's their project too, now. They'll tweet out when their code goes into a release, and add it to their CV.

Maybe you've been an external contributor to an open source project prior to become a project maintainer - maybe you haven't.

Either way, you probably haven't thought about creating a contributor experience, systematically. 

That is what we are going to look at here. 

Why? Because repeat contributions, like repeat customers, come from an extraordinary experience. Not everyone will repeat - but if your contributor experience is extraordinary, you will increase the amount of contributions.

## Who Contributes

Let's first consider _who_ contributes.

We will create a few archetypes.

**First-timer**: The first-timer is someone who has never contributed to any open source project before. This is all new to them. They don't know how to "open a pull request", they are not sure if their contribution will be good enough to be accepted, and if they do take the plunge, how this pull request goes will determine how their entire open source contribution career goes. No pressure.

**Seasoned Pro**: 

## Characteristics of External Contributors 

People are usually busy. They might be using your project for their day job. You are focused on the project itself - it's the main event. For a lot of potential contributors, however, your project probably is one piece in a complex stack of technology that they are wrestling with. It's an extra on the show. 

Any contribution that people make to the project is a generous contribution of their valuable time.

## How to create an Extraordinary Contributor Experience

### Put the sign out in front

Every business needs to let people know that they exist, and that they are open for business. Let people know that you accept contributions. Put it at the top of the README.md file, so that it's one of the first things that they read, with a link to the contribution instructions.

It's one thing to include a CONTRIBUTING.md file in your repo, it's another thing to "stand out on the sidewalk and hand out fliers". "Putting the sign out in front" doesn't mean the front of the project - it means _in front of the contributor_. People will land in different places in your project from a search engine, or by focusing in on a specific area of interest. If you catch them at the right moment, in the right place, with the right message, a brief moment of inspiration can convert into a contribution.

Everywhere that represents a touch point or an area that the community can contribute to, weave it into the narrative.

Put it in the Getting Started instructions: "_If you find something wrong or missing in here, feel free to submit a pull request._" (with a link to the documentation contribution section of your contribution instructions).

Put it in the API documentation. Put it in the issue template. Put it everywhere (but don't overdo it). 

You want to "_walk the floor_". Start with a blank mind, and approach your project as a new user. Go to your repository, your documentation, and your package / image hosting page, and walk through them as a new user. 

Is it obvious that I can contribute to this project? Is it obvious how I do that, or how I find out how to do that?

### Make it Easy

The lower the barrier to entry, the more people will cross over it.

If you put links in your documentation so that someone can see something wrong or missing, click a link, correct it and submit a Pull Request, people are more likely to do it.

If you make it a single click from your README to report a bug, with a template that they can fill out, people are more likely to do it. If you want people to search existing bug reports first, then give them a link to the existing issues filter, with instructions to search, followed by a link to open a new issue.

If you want people to contribute code, then you need to document how to develop the project. This means installing all prerequisites and building the project. The more of this that you can script, the easier you make it. Potential contributors can burn all of their inspiration trying to get the project to build, before they even think about writing code.

Again, "walk the floor". Starting with a blank mind, approach the project as a new user. How easy is it to check out and build? Can you make it easier?

This can be challenging, because your computer is configured to build the project, and may have dependencies or tools that are required, but not covered by your instructions. Again, this is a perfect opportunity to weave in
