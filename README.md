# Hacktoberfest

These are files related to [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).

They describe how to create an extraordinary contributor experience for Hacktoberfest specifically, and for open source contributors in general. 

* [CONTRIBUTING.template.md](CONTRIBUTING.template.md) contains a template for a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for your repository. This orients contributors to make it easy for them to contribute and easy for you to accept their contributions with the least amount of (re)work. You should customise this file to match your project's standards.

* [CONTRIBUTOR_EXPERIENCE.md](CONTRIBUTOR_EXPERIENCE.md) is a short guide to creating an extraordinary contributor experience, and contains some ideas and actions that you can take to ensure that people find it easy and enjoyable to contribute to your project, and come back to do it again - and again!

* [PR_LIFECYCLE.md](PR_LIFECYCLE.md) describes the typical life-cycle of a pull request, and is useful to set expectations on what happens after a contributor clicks "Submit Pull Request". This is useful for Hacktoberfest, when we are actively encouraging people to contribute, many for the first time.
